	<h1 class = "MyTitle">My Background</h4>
	<p class = "MyText">I'm from Fremont, NE and I went to high school in a little town called Cedar Bluffs. I am a Computer Science major. On campus I'm involved in a few different 
	clubs and am a member of <b id="PhiSig">Phi Sigma Kappa</b>. I have no previous CS related work experience, I've only ever detassled and worked as a stocker at my local grocery 
	store.</p>
	
	<h1 class = "MyTitle">My Plans</h4>
	<p class = "MyText">My future plans are to do entry level programming work for the first few years of my career, then once I have some experience either try to move on to
	becoming a Software Engineer or starting my own business</p>
	
	<h1 class = "MyTitle">My Interests</h4>
	<p class = "MyText">Like most other CS majors, maybe stereotyping a bit, I like to play video games. I enjoy playing intramural sports like basketball. I'm also learning how to
	play guitar, so that has been taking up some of my free time lately. I also enjoy reading when I get the chance.</p>
